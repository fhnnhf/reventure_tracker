# Reventure tracker

This poptracker package is meant for manually tracking items for the Reventure ending randomizer and archipelago. Not only does it help keep track of what items you have but it also shows which endings are currently in logic. There is also a manual ending tracker to keep count of how many endings you have if you are running a custom ending seed. Enjoy!

## Installation

Just download the lastest build or source and put in your packs folder (unpacked).

## Feedback

Any and all feedback is appreciated. I can be reached at fhnnhf on discord or in the reventure development channel at on the official Archipelago Discord server.
